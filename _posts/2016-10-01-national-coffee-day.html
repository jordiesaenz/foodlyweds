<p>What better way to celebrate National Coffee Day than at the Specialty Coffee Association Open House?! One celebratory cup of coffee wouldn’t have been enough for coffee lovers like us; we had to go somewhere we knew we’d get to try new stuff and experience coffee companies that were new to us. From shakeratos to a nitro golden milk stout beer to the donut selfie wall, we were in for a major treat.</p>
<p>Check out some of the deliciousness we got to partake in!</p>

  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Costa Mesa, Tustin, Santa Ana, Old Towne Orange, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach (Theorem is at the Costa Mesa shop!)</p>
  <p>A little bit about Theorem: "Theorem is a 6-seat coffee concept bar that asks the question: 'Is coffee a beverage or an ingredient?' By answering that question with an emphatic YES, we show customers that it is both...Theorem is a walk-up bar where select baristas are given the creative freedom to develop personalized coffee menus that showcase amazingly creative coffee drinks. The drinks served on these menus vary as much as the baristas do, but have included cocktail-inspired drinks such as a Coffee Sour, an Old Fashioned prepared with slow drip cold-brewed coffee barrel aged in oak for six months, and a cold-brewed coffee sangria, to mention just a few.”</p>
  <p>And that is just the type of thing they were serving up! They had three different creative drinks going on, featuring coffee like you’ve never tried it before.</p>

  <p>It was our first time trying Equator Coffee and let us just say - that shakerato is LIT. Wow, we could’ve drank 30.</p>
  <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> "In 2011, Equator was the first coffee roaster in the U.S. to become a certified B Corp., solidifying its role as a company that is part of a global movement redefining impact and success in business, while valuing everyone in the supply chain...From [their] farmers’ communities to our local cafés, Equator’s mission is to create a positive impact.” </p>
  <p>They are doing so much for the world - so awesome.</p>

  <p>We’ve tried a lot of donuts in our day, but never a lemon blueberry one and never hand-picked straight from a donut selfie wall, so that was a fun first.</p>

<p>Shoutout to the SCAA for throwing this, supporting specialty coffee, and having such amazing gifts for visitors on the way out. Oh, and the tacos were fantastic as well.</p>
