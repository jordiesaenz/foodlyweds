<p>Did we eat donuts in Denver? OF COURSE. We’re pretty determined to discover all the delicious donuts there are in the world. (#alliteration) We were lucky to find that this doughtnut shop is connected to Carbon Cafe and the incredible Chef Jason Graf has whipped up some pretty amazing things over on Platte Street.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some of our favorites from the Habit!</strong></p>

<p>With a slogan like “Donuts under the influence. Everyone loves a buzz,” you know you’re in for a treat.</p>

  <h2>Habit Doughnut:</h2>

  <p>Raspberry glaze, raspberry streusel, blueberries and white chocolate drizzle. Honestly, this is one of the best doughnuts we've ever had, and we've had a lot. The icing's flavor is somewhat bold, yet not overwhelming. It's rich, yet the fruity, berry flavor balances it out. If we lived in Denver, we'd probably be eating these every day. It's easy to see why they call it the "Habit" Doughnut.</p>

  <h2>PB&J Doughnut:</h2>

  <p>Strawberry jam, peanut butter drizzle and candied peanuts. Seriously, this tastes just like PB&J in doughnut form. It's like a time machine right back to your childhood.</p>

  <p>First you take the graham, you stick the chocolate on the graham. Then you roast the 'mallow. AND THEN YOU MAKE IT A DONUT. Chocolate glaze, graham cracker crumbles, and ACTUAL TOASTED MARSHMALLOW make this doughnut feel like you're actually camping in the mountains, chillin' by the fire while we eatin' smores doughnuts.</p>

  <h2>Trailblazer Doughnut:</h2>

  <p>A cran-orange glaze, with toasted coconut, toasted almonds, brown butter streusel and candied dried cranberries. This doughnut was more mellow than the others, in the best way possible. The nutty flavors, paired with citrus of the orange and tartness of the cranberry gave us the impression of a mixture of Thanksgiving dessert and trailmix, haha. It was absolutely delicious.</p>

<p>And don’t worry - they have gluten free options!</p>

<p>They let us watch their process of creating the Habit Donut, and let us just say - donut design is quite the artform.</p>

<p>They also let us watch them make their Blazed donut (Bruleed malted milk glaze). We were captivated. We’ve never seen anyone torch a donut, but more people should, because this tasted SO GOOD. Grand Marnier, a glazed donut, and a little bit of fire, and you have a culinary masterpiece. A boozy, beautiful masterpiece.</p>

<p>We went into the Habit Doughnut Dispensary expecting delicious donuts, but got so much more! Look at these incredible meals you can order next door.</p>

  <p>Grass-fed beef, applewood smoked bacon, swiss, house pickles, DMZ secret sauce, housemade brioche bun. This might have been one of the best burgers we've had. The bacon was thick and crispy, the meat juicy and tender. We could swim in the sauce.</p>
  <p>And you guys. Those tots. They’re insane. Fly to Denver now just for the tots. We're not kidding.</p>

  <p>We actually ate this, it's GIGANTIC. Like, bigger than our heads. Like, so big it was a struggle to pick it up and take a bite. The struggle was real, and the struggle was WORTH IT.</p>
  <p>All the food that this Carbon was bringing out of their kitchen were so beautifully crafted, we wish we could have eaten it all.</p>
