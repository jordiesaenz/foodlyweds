        <p>We're two newlyweds living in Orange County, and to put it simply, we're eating all the things. Donuts. Coffee. Burgers. Boba. Pizza. You name it, we're into it.</p>
        <p>As we would plan dates, we would always look for new places to check out and we'd head out on our foodventures even if the restaurant was 30+ miles away. Ain't no stopping us. Even when it came to vacations, we found we weren't seeking out beaches and hotels and instead were looking up the best food, desserts, and drinks in the city we were headed to. (Check out #notsosunnymoon to see everything we enjoyed on our honeymoon.)</p>
        <p>Without intending to, we kind of became the people our friends would text and ask for recommendations. One day, it hit us that our personal Instagram accounts were full of food and drink photos that could instead have a feed of their own. So on January 30, 2016, @foodlyweds officially began and we've been visiting new places ever since.</p>
        <p>We love sharing our finds with others so we are so glad you found us and our site! We can't wait to show you the epic treats we find, and we can't wait to hear your recommendations. If you have a place you think we'd like, please send us a message!</p>
